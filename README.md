ArduinoCNC
==========

This repository is used in our school project to enable the members to organise their code on a central point.


We're going to implement drivers to get our CNC mill up and running (or at least we're trying to :) )

For hardware we're using:
* 1 x Arduino UNO (Rev 3) circuit board
* 3 x EasyDriver stepper motor drivers
* 3 x (Nema 17) stepper motors with 200 steps/revolution



 Please stay tuned for updates :)
